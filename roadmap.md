# Roadmap

## Version 1

esoTalk continues to move towards stable release. From there, bug-fix releases will be made.

## Version 2

Version 2 of esoTalk will be completely redesigned, rebranded, rewritten from scratch using the [Laravel Framework](http://laravel.com). The only thing it will retain is esoTalk's core philosophy: to be fast, simple, and powerful. Development will begin in late 2013.
